            <h2>Jean-Dominique Bauby</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Suffered a massive stroke, woke up 20 days later unable to do anything but blink a single eye-lid</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Locked-in Syndrome</u>: Mental faculties are intact, but majority of skeletal muscles are paralyzed</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Categories of Nervous System Function</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Sensory</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Perception is interpretation of the outside/internal world. Sometimes inaccurate in predictable ways (Gestalt principles, equally sized circles surrounded by either large or small circles, motion illusion). Perception/interpretation is dependent on context</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Homeostasis</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Maintains internal balance, so to speak</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Heat beat, breathing, gut function, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Autonomic reaction/arousal comes like a full package, all the responses always happen and at once</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Abstract/Higher</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Involved in cognition, thinking, higher order computation, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Motor</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor neurons, also known as motoneurons and/or lower motor neurons, are neurons in the central nervous system that <u>only</u> target skeletal muscle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- No other neurons ‘talk’ to skeletal muscle, and skeletal muscle cannot act/’say’ anything on its own / of its own volition</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor cortex goes to motor neurons (either indirectly or directly), known as the motor hierarchy</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Final Common Pathway (Sherrington)</u>: central nervous system control of behavior in which all motor control signals ultimately synapse on motor neurons</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Structures Involved in Motor Control</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cerebellum</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Coordinates large scale, complex movements</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Not</u> necessary for simple movements (ie movement of a finger up and down)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- ‘Thinking’ can interfere with function</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Coordinates between agonist (“go”) and antagonist (“break”) signals</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Loss of cerebellum leads to ataxia – loss of full control of bodily movement</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Basal Ganglia</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Responsible for action selection / as a result is anti-multitasking</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Starting point is to do nothing, then listens to cerebrum and decides what cerebrum is emphasizing</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- ‘Tied’ into cerebral cortex so to speak, so movements controlled by it more affected by thinking/cognition. Also involved in thought selection.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Composed of the <u>striatum</u> and <u>palladum</u></span>

Immediately surrounding the neural tube is neural crest, which gives rise to most of the peripheral nervous system. Within the primordial head region of the developing embryo, neuroepithelium develops into pre-placodal ectoderm (blue area), which eventually populates seven bilateral pairs of placodes (yellow areas), five of which give rise to sensory neurons.</span>

            <h1>Lecture 2: Cellular Organization of Vertebrate Central Nervous System</h1>
            <h2>Corpus Callosum</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Connects the two telencephalic hemispheres, connecting one place in one hemisphere to its analogous partner on the other hemisphere</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Keeps the pieces of the brain from floating apart</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Forms a physical joining between the telencephalon and the diencephalon: <u>internal capsule</u>, which is almost all descending information, except when info goes back up from thalamus/hypothalamus to cortex via the capsule</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Normally, holding something in the left hand gives sensory input to the right hemisphere of the brain, but that information is normally transmitted across the corpus callosum to the left hemisphere to language areas of the brain so that you can say “I am holding a coin”. <u>Without the corpus callosum, you would not be able to say this.</u></span>

            <h2>More On Neurulation: Chick Embryo!</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Neural ectoderm plate invaginates, becomes a groove, then buds off as a neural tube</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ 24 hour chick embryo</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Somites</u> are blocks of mesoderm on either side of the neural tube. Each corresponds to piece of the spinal cord</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Brain starting to swell</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ 33 hour chick embryo</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- A lot more swelling of vesicles</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- More somites</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ 48 hour chick embryo</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Head vesicles have expanded greatly, optic vesicle forms (buds off the diencephalon)</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cross section of neural tube</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Right side is dorsal, side with the neural tube</span>

            <h2>Structure of Neurons</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Soma</u>: circular cell body</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Dendrites</u>: processes extending outward from cell bodies, receive information from outside, decrements in size like branches</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Axons</u>: processes coming off of soma, transmits information, doesn't decrement in size</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Synaptic terminal</u>: where information output actually occurs</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Boutons</u>: circular endpoints where <u>chemical transmission</u> occurs between synaptic partners</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Chemical transmission occurs via the release of neurotransmitters</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Synaptic Cleft</u>: space between axon terminal and postsynaptic partner (usually dendrite)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Huge influx of calcium allows presynaptic neuron to release packaged neurotransmitters</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Vesicle fuses with presynaptic membrane (Presynaptic terminal), releases neurotransmitter</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane (postsynaptic element)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Postsynaptic partner can be another neuron or a muscle or other things for peripheral neuron (will explain later)</span>

            <h2>Cell Theory</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cell theory used to be applied to all cells except those in the nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Nervous system was thought to be one big syncytium, large mass of stuff, neurons are not individual cells</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Neuron Doctrine</u>: Ramon y Cajal uses Golgi staining to say that the nervous system is not a syncytium and is made up of individual and unique cells, approaching his science like an artist</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Microglia</u>: immune cells of the brain</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- When foreign stuff comes into brain, become reactive</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Only cell type in the nervous system that does not come from neuroectoderm</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Comes from hematopoietic line</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Macroglia</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Astrocytes</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Found in the central nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Small, star-like, lots of processes</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Involved in synapse stabilization, surround synapses to hold them together</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Important for recycling neurotransmitters (Glutamate has a cycle that necessarily uses glia since the neuron cannot make its own glutamate)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- In the periphery (dorsal root ganglion), there is a similar thing called <u>satellite cells</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Same functions as <u>astrocytes</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Also in the dorsal root ganglion, the neurons are very close together</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ These neurons do not have dendrites and there are no synapses within this ganglion. This is just a place where many neurons live but do not act</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Oligodendrocytes</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Central nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Derive from neural tube</span>

            <h2>Nerves and Neurons Fibers</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Nerves</u>: mixed, have two/three components</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- All have sensory/motor components, some have autonomic components</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Trauma affects all three components</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Interrupt autonomic nerves: loss of <u>trophic factors</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Interrupt motor neurons: weakness</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Interrupt sensory neurons: numbness/pins and needles/burning pain, <u>positive symptoms: paresthesia</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Sensory Components</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Sensory information comes in from, say, receptors on the skin</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- These sensory neurons sit in the dorsal root ganglion (periphery) and connect to both the skin and the spinal cord</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Peripheral neuron</u>: cell body is in periphery</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Sensory neurons are each dedicated to a certain modality/stimulus</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Example: specific sensory nerves react to light touch, to vibration, to pain, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Large Fibers</u>: myelinated</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>Proprioceptive</u>: information is coming back from muscles and joints and telling you about the position of your body. Doesn’t come to consciousness, is just fed into the motor system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>Tactile</u>: touch, vibration, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Small fibers</u>: unmyelinated</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ sharp pains</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Dull, aching/burning pains</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Changes in temperature, itch</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Can have a problem with either large OR small diameter fibers but not both</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>Congenital Insensitivity to Pain (CIPA or HSAN III)</u>: damage to small fibers, associated with <u>Anhydrosis</u> (cant sweat)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Small fibers do not develop due to a gene that is required for their lineage</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Peripheral autonomic nerves (unmyelinated small nerves that go from autonomic ganglion to the smooth muscle) come from the same lineage as small fibers</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ So both small fibers and peripheral autonomic nerves don’t develop</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Cannot sense pain and does not sweat</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ How do these individuals come to attention (in their first year of life)?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ During teething, baby feels no pain when their teeth come in and they continue teething</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>Self-mutilation</u>: bite off their fingers</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Motor Components</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor neurons connect from spinal cord to skeletal muscle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Central neuron: cell body is in central nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Autonomic Components</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Neuron from spinal cord goes to autonomic ganglion, and another neuron from the autonomic ganglion innervates smooth muscle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Example: <u>Micturition</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ External urethral sphincter is a skeletal muscle (conscious action)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Eventually the smooth muscles in the internal sphincter also contract autonomically/subconsciously</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Axonal Transport</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Need axons if communication is occurring from between far away cells</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Anterograde</u>: sending things from sell body to axon terminal</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Shipment of vesicles, proteins, neurotransmitters, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- The garbage (excess or used proteins) must be shipped back to cell body where there are lysozymes</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Retrograde</u>: sending things from axon terminal back to cell body</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Tau</u>: molecule important for axon transport in both directions</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Pretty unifying theory that all neurodegenerative diseases are due to improper functioning of tau</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Parkinsons, alzheimers, ALS, prion’s disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Huntington’s, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Why do we have multiple synapses instead of just having huge long axons to communicate between far away places?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Gives flexibility, ability to integrate multiple things so that output is not always same as input</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Example: if we cut sensory neurons, could move for some reasons but not others</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Counter example: if cut motor neuron, could never move that muscle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor neuron to muscle is 1 to 1 (input = output)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ How does <u>Polio</u> attack motor neurons?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Peripheral neurons have a vulnerability from being in the periphery</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Peripheral motoneurons takes up polio virus and transports it back to CNS</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Neurotropic virus that acts like a trophic factor</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Spinal cord: has two swellings</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Cervical and lumbo-sacral</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Topographic: areas higher up innervate upper-body, lower areas innervate lower-body</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cranial nerve vs spinal nerve</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Depends on where nerve leaves from</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Sections of nerves</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Cranial, cervical, trunk, lumbar, sacral</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Sensitive in fingertips not in lumbar region</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Due to number of neurons/receptors in each area</span>

            <h1>Lecture 4: Spinal/Cranial Nerves and Facial Expression</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Spinal Nerve</u>: leaves the vertebral column</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- All have sensory and motor components, some have autonomic</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Cranial Nerves</u>: leave the cranium</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Some have sensory components, some have motor, some are mixed (and have autonomic)</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Facial Nerve (VII)</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Facial Nerve (VII)</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Mixed cranial nerve</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor aspects</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Innervates muscles of facial expression </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ These muscles attach to skin (not bone)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Does not include chewing muscles, muscles that move your eyes, or one of the middle ear muscles (tensor tympani)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Innervates the stapedius (middle ear)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ The motor neurons that innervate the muscles of facial expression and the stapedius sit in the same area (Facial Nucleus) in the Central Nervous System</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Autonomic (parasympathetic) effect -> makes tears, saliva, nasal mucosa</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ This neuron also comes from the central nervous system (Salivatory Nucleus), goes to the autonomic ganglion, and another neuron innervates a salivary gland</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Sensory aspects</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Taste from anterior 2/3 of tongue</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ This sensory neuron in the peripheral nervous system goes to the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (NTS) in the central nervous system, which is involved in the perception of taste</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ S-S from part of the ear</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Ear receives somatosensory information from multiple nerves, including the facial nerve</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ This sensory neuron also comes from some ganglion and ends up in the Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus (SVN)  in the central nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- If cut on one side (<u>Bell’s palsy</u>), symptoms:</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Can’t move half of the face</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Dry mouth, dry eyes, dry nose</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Sounds will start to sound louder (hyperacusis)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Positive signs, dysesthesia/paresthesia – wrong feeling when you should not feel something (ear pain, ringing noise)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Lose some taste in front 2/3 of tongue</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Looking at coronal cross-section through the pons: level of facial colliculus</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Black is staining for myelin/axons</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Gray areas are cell bodies mixed in with axons and dendrites</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Facial nerve comes out of the edge of the pons</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ During development, the facial nerve comes from the pons, and as it migrates they drag behind their axons and go around another cranial nerve nucleus (Abducins nucleus)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- All other cranial nerves shoot straight from the cranium and out</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- If you have a stroke at the abducins nucleus, what symptoms would you have?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Would be unable to abduct (move laterally) your eye on the side of the injury</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Would not be able to move muscles on that side nor the stapidus (like Bell’s palsy)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ No problems with taste, somatosensory info, or dry mouth/nose/etc. (unlike Bell’s palsy)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Group of functionally related neurons with a functionally related output that is not always all-or-nothing</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ In other words, there’s no actual connection between the facial nucleus and the salivatory nucleus except that the axons that extend from those nuclei “jump on the same street”</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Moebius syndrome</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- No facial expression</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- No naso-labial fold</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Slight adduction of the eye</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Top-down control of making facial expressions</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Facial nerve needs information from the cerebral cortex (specifically the motor cortex)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor cortex innervates motor neurons directly</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ For motor neurons that go to the hands and the feet, go through the corticospinal tract</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ But for motor neurons that go to the facial muscles (expressions, chewing, tongue movement, shrugging, turning head), go through the corticobulbar tract</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Not the eyes though</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Only the nerves for facial expression go through the corticobulbar tract (not the ones for moving the stapedius)	</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor cortex can also innervate interneurons that then innervate motor neurons</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Example: the muscle that allows you to raise one eyebrow at a time</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Say that the top part of the facial nucleus innervates the top muscles of the face and the bottom part of the facial nucleus innervates the bottom half of the face. The motor cortex innervates both the top and bottom halves of the facial nucleus separately</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Can do something in one context and not in another</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor cortex is topographically arranged</span>

            <h1>Lecture 5: Organization of the Spine and Brain</h1>
            <h2>The Spinal Cord has a general organization</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ White matter is "bigger at the top and smaller at the bottom"</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+	The initial development of the spinal cord is divided into the <u>basal plate</u> and the <u>alar plate</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Grey matter has neurons split into three different areas</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">-	<u>dorsal</u>: dorsal root carries sensory information to the dorsal root ganglion</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>ventral</u>: motor information; skeletal/somato motor!! send axons to the ventral horn </span>
            <div class="image">
                <img class="image-inside" src="img/spine1.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>thoracic horn</u>: how do we know? we have a skinny little ventral horn; the ventral horn has motor neurons that sits in a collection called pools</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- the pools are organized in sagittal columns and are topographically organized</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- "the pools that are most mediately situated, innervate the axial musculature”</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- as I go laterally, I get the the limbs </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- so what will be in cervical that won’t be in thoracic?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ the ventral horn will be larger in the lateral direction because you have innervation of the arms as well</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>How do you differentiate from the dorsal and ventral?</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Ventral has a large fissure (arteries travel through there)</span>
            <div class="image">
                <img class="image-inside" src="img/spine2.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Spinomedullary junction</u>: where the spinal cord connects to the medulla in the brainstem</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ In the image below, we can see the dorsal side of the spinal cord</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- The blue area stains for myelin</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- The pink is the beginning of a nucleus</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Shows motor neurons that are big and pink</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Cranial nerve 11 innervates the muscles that allow you to shrug</span>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <br>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ If we diagram the spinal cord we can see that it has the acronym SAM: <u>sensory, autonomic, motor</u></span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Spinal cord and the brainstem</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ lumen progressively gets pushed up and the eventually meet at which point you essentially have an opened up into the fourth ventricle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ What's on the outside? <u>sensory</u>; on the inside, <u>motor</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ if we made a divide in one section what would we find more medially and what would we find laterally?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Medial: somatomotor, Lateral: autonomics</u></span>
            <div class="image">
                <img class="image-inside" src="img/spine4.jpg"/>
            </div>
            <br>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ in the head region we have muscles that didn't come from somites</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- they are from <u>branchial arches</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ ex: muscles of the facial expression, chewing, shrugging, swallowing</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ the ones from somites are eye muscles and tongue muscles</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Midbrain, Pons, Medulla: The Brainstem!</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ functions “ascend in loftiness as you ascend from caudal to rostral”</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Medulla</u>: organizes breathing, blood pressure, gut motility and similar functions; you are not aware of these functions typically (you can be aware of breathing but you don’t have to be); vestibular functions, hearing, taste</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Pons</u>: facial movements (<u>abduction</u> of the eye), REM sleep, <u>atonia</u> (the pons projects down the spinal cord and inhibits motor neurons during REM sleep), what happens with this connection is broken? sleep behavior disorder </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Vestibular Function</u>: gonna tell us where our head is in space and how it is accelerating in space; that is useful for keeping balance (projections from vestibular nuclei to spinal cord), keeping our gaze steady on whatever we are looking at (off to pons and midbrain bc midbrain has the rest of the extra ocular muscles), most of how you move you eye is controlled by the midbrain</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Midbrain</u>: also has an area called the locomotor center; this area when stimulated causes movements in gait (the cat has a gate and with more stimulus the cat starts to run or trot), central pattern generator (an area that can out put movement without you being conscious of it) </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Reticular Activating System (RAS)</u>: area when stimulated can wake a person up more; there are some individuals that are in minimally conscious state… the problem is here, they can not be aroused</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Cerebellum</u>: not technically part of the brain stem, but coordinating all movements, synapses with midbrain which controls gaze</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ the brainstem has to be dead in order for you to be considered brain dead</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- two particular functions of the brain stem that we think about when characterizing brain death</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Vestibulo ocular reflex, Apnea</span>
            <div class="image">

            </div>
            <br>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Opening of the fourth ventricle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Inferior Olive</u>: located in the medulla; coordinate signals from the spinal cord to the cerebellum to regulate motor coordination and learning; projects to the cerebellum and gives a teaching signal to the cerebellum</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ ex: when you learn a new piece of music and you mess up, the inferior olive gets a signal and feeds it forward to the cerebellum to correct the next iteration of that movement</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Caudal Midbrain</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Output from cerebellum</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- has a tract that coordinates eye movements </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>trochlear nucleus</u>: innervates one extraoccular muscle (superior oblique) it’s nerve comes out of the top and has a “torturous journey"</span>

            <br>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Nucleus accumbens - involved with sweetness</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Ventricular system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Corpus callosum and where it is - how far back does it go with coronal cuts</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Where diencephalon is along the brain</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Anterior commissure - tough and a lot of axons</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Caudate and putamen - striatum</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Interoception, taste, smell - globus pallidus </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Globus and pallidus are basal ganglia key elements</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Lenticular nucleus</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Substantia nigra - parkinsons - black stuff</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cerebral peduncle - base of midbrain</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Internal capsule</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Hippocampus - has thin layer of white matter on top of it that becomes the fornix</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Grey matter touching lateral ventricle is caudate</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Choroid plexus</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Where you see cerebral aqueduct is where midbrain is</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Pineal gland</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Sinus - collect venous blood, used up blood from the cerebrum</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Falx cerebri </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Jugular vein</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Huntington's - neurons die and ventricles enlarge because the neurons die, more space to take up</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Silvian fissure</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Tentorium</span>

            <h2>Structures in vertebrates: In what ways can fibers be organized?</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Brain nuclei </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Clusters of neurons that have similar functions NOT to be confused with the nucleus of a cell</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Reticular fibers: </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Some structures in hind brain have this structure rather than the nuclei structure</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Technically defined as “not anatomically well defined because it includes neurons located in diverse parts of the brain” so identify it as not either of the other two…</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Laminated structure (cortex particularly in mammals) </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- cerebellum and cerebrum</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- layered organization</span>

            <h2>Invertebrate ganglion</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ defined as a swelling that has neuronal cell bodies that are arranged on the outside of the ganglion and centrally you have the neuropil</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ this arrangement is also seen in the invertebrate brains</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Reflected in morphology arrangements of invertebrates</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Example: scorpion brain we see the neuronal cell bodies in the periphery of the neuropil</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ what’s a neuropil?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- The neuropil is defined as “the space between neuronal and glial cell bodies that is comprised of dendrites, axons, synapses, glial cell processes, and microvasculature”</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- In vertebrates we have cell bodies embedded within our neuropil; a collection of cell bodies in vertebrates and have no “internal neuropil” arrangement</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ the only thing that relates ganglion between invertebrates and vertebrates is that they are a swelling on a nerve fiber</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ so would we call it a nervous system or not? </span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- no: we consider nervous systems to be composed of set aside group of cells that specifically perform neuronal functions </span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- we can say that sponges do not have true nervous systems, even though they exhibit behavior</span>

            <h2>Requirements of nervous systems</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ communication </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ organization of effector tissue</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ What kinds of nervous systems can you imagine?</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Simplest: a single neuronal cell; sensory-motor neuron</span>

                    <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Next step in complexity:</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Two types of neurons: sensory neuron, motor neuron</span>

                    <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Third in complexity and most typical:</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ three types of neurons: sensory, motor, interneuron</span>

            <h2>Effector tissue is not technically a part of the nervous system because they are not neurons</h2>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ can perform forward genetics screens </span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- *forward genetics is when you can use the phenotype and move towards identifying the gene responsible, and the opposite is called reverse genetics where you start with a known gene and mutate in a way to determine its function by analyzing the resultant phenotypes</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ sensory neurons are clustered in the head</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ the motor neurons are in the head and extend down the ventral surface of the body </span>

                            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- we use myelin (pain is an unmyelinated pathway which is why it takes a minute for us to feel the pain)</span>
            **The size of the brains is not included in this, meaning the size of an organism’s brain does correspond to our classical definition of “intelligence” ex: octopus vs mice </span>

            <h2>Remember, biology has exceptions</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ these are not necessarily hard and fast distinctions between vertebrates and invertebrates</span>



            <h2>What is cortex??</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ vertebrate definition of cortex has three properties</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- grey matter on the surface of the brain</span>

                    <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ type 1 neurons: called projection neurons that are responsible for sending info out</span>
                        <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ type 2 neurons: neurons that restrict their dendrites and axons</span>

            <h2>Brain size</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ whales have massive brains so does that mean they are smarter than us???</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ does brain size have anything to do with intelligence?</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- we need to look at brain AND body size</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ how big is our brain? </span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- if we plot brain size and body size, we see that our brains are very big in comparison to our own body </span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-2">- so we can take the log function of these mammals and see that yes there are some outliers but there is a clear linear relationship between body weight and brain weight</span>

            <h2>ctenophores</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ type of jellyfish (comb jellies) that has a nervous system that opens and closes their mouth</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ there are 6 cell types but none look anything like neurons suggesting that comb jelly fish are not a part of the broader family of jelly fish bc jelly fish have a conventional nervous system</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ because of that, evolutionary biologists think that comb jellyfish </span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- lost neurons</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-2">- evolved independently</span>
                        <span class="bullet bullet-2">- might have been placed in the wrong evolution group</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ cerebral cortex (coronal slice)</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- two sheets for each hemisphere that can be layed out </span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-2">- so far we have been talking about one particular kind of cortex (neo cortex) </span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ neo cortex is called isocortex because in humans it kind of looks the same as you move across it; but near the edges the cortex thins out and becomes three layered cortex (but still counts as cortex) found along the medial and posterior edge of cerebral cortex and that is the hippocampal formation</span> 
                        <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ periform cortex: primary olfactory cortex</span>
                            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- how big is cerebral cortex if you flatten it out? how many pizzas?</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ 14-16”</span>
                        <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ very difficult to get these measurements even today</span>
                            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ one hemisphere is 800 square cm</span>
                                <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ what about a rat?? 7.6cm</span>
                                    <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ but humans have a surface area is about 1600cm2 dealing with the size of brains by making sulci and gyri so about 2/3 of it are actually tucked away</span>

            <h2>things are topographically mapped in the brain</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ but what about the rest of the cortex that isn’t primary sensory?</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- researchers looked at Nissels stains </span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-2">- distinguished 5 different areas of psycho-architecture</span>
                        <span class="bullet bullet-2">- but Brodmann divided that brain as well and is what it typically used; about 50 areas identified</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ each of these areas should have different functions but it was never done like that and would be difficult to do</span>
                        <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ it has been done in rats and divided neo cortex using a lot of functional studies; there are about 30 areas in a rat </span>
                            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ in monkeys there are about 70 areas</span>
                                <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ what’s the surface area of one hemisphere? 70cm2</span>
                                    <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ eye muscles are not innervated in motor cortex ! Only voluntary muscles not there and that are innervated in FEF</span>
                                        <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Glasser et al. did it again and got about 180 areas based on fMRI data in order to try and divide up neo cortex </span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ cross section of rat</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- we see neo cortex and hippocampus </span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-2">- 1.5 cm of the surface area and 1.2 cm is hippocampus but in humans we had 15cm which is not proportional based on the difference in surface area of cortex</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ in mice there is a huge dedication of somatosensory cortex to the whiskers</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- mice have several representations of each of the whiskers in the brain because each whisker is incredibly sensitive</span>
                    <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ in humans it would be the hands! (see homunculus image)</span>
                        <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ in star nosed moles: has weird lil nose that helps it sense the world around it; if you look in the neo cortex, you will find that each of these rays has its own separate representation in the brain</span>
                            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ so this shows us that if you move across species the size of individual areas corresponds to the ecology of the world that these animals face which explains that disporpotaional sizes between mice and humans; this holds as we discuss animals in the vertebrates</span>
                                <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ the spinal chord corresponds to about 2% of the volume of the CNS in humans but in rodents its about 30%</span>

                <span class="bullet bullet-2">- whats the cortical anatomy?</span>

                    <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ mormyrid electric fish: they go around and send out an electric field and then use it as a radar to sense the reflected electric field which is why they can live in darker areas of water; the way they deal with this information is through cerebellum</span>
                        <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ trout</span>
                <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ bichir: has a large telencephalon; having a big telen. is not that special; in fish, we see that fish with big telens. are sharks, ratfish, dogfish</span>
