            <h2>Jean-Dominique Bauby</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Suffered a massive stroke, woke up 20 days later unable to do anything but blink a single eye-lid</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Locked-in Syndrome</u>: Mental faculties are intact, but majority of skeletal muscles are paralyzed</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Categories of Nervous System Function</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Sensory</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Perception is interpretation of the outside/internal world. Sometimes inaccurate in predictable ways (Gestalt principles, equally sized circles surrounded by either large or small circles, motion illusion). Perception/interpretation is dependent on context</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Homeostasis</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Maintains internal balance, so to speak</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Heat beat, breathing, gut function, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Autonomic reaction/arousal comes like a full package, all the responses always happen and at once</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Abstract/Higher</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Involved in cognition, thinking, higher order computation, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Motor</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor neurons, also known as motoneurons and/or lower motor neurons, are neurons in the central nervous system that <u>only</u> target skeletal muscle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- No other neurons ‘talk’ to skeletal muscle, and skeletal muscle cannot act/’say’ anything on its own / of its own volition</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor cortex goes to motor neurons (either indirectly or directly), known as the motor hierarchy</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Final Common Pathway (Sherrington)</u>: central nervous system control of behavior in which all motor control signals ultimately synapse on motor neurons</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Structures Involved in Motor Control</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cerebellum</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Coordinates large scale, complex movements</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Not</u> necessary for simple movements (ie movement of a finger up and down)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- ‘Thinking’ can interfere with function</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Coordinates between agonist (“go”) and antagonist (“break”) signals</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Loss of cerebellum leads to ataxia – loss of full control of bodily movement</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Basal Ganglia</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Responsible for action selection / as a result is anti-multitasking</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Starting point is to do nothing, then listens to cerebrum and decides what cerebrum is emphasizing</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- ‘Tied’ into cerebral cortex so to speak, so movements controlled by it more affected by thinking/cognition. Also involved in thought selection.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Composed of the <u>striatum</u> and <u>palladum</u></span>

Immediately surrounding the neural tube is neural crest, which gives rise to most of the peripheral nervous system. Within the primordial head region of the developing embryo, neuroepithelium develops into pre-placodal ectoderm (blue area), which eventually populates seven bilateral pairs of placodes (yellow areas), five of which give rise to sensory neurons.</span>

            <h1>Lecture 2: Cellular Organization of Vertebrate Central Nervous System</h1>
            <h2>Corpus Callosum</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Connects the two telencephalic hemispheres, connecting one place in one hemisphere to its analogous partner on the other hemisphere</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Keeps the pieces of the brain from floating apart</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Forms a physical joining between the telencephalon and the diencephalon: <u>internal capsule</u>, which is almost all descending information, except when info goes back up from thalamus/hypothalamus to cortex via the capsule</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Normally, holding something in the left hand gives sensory input to the right hemisphere of the brain, but that information is normally transmitted across the corpus callosum to the left hemisphere to language areas of the brain so that you can say “I am holding a coin”. <u>Without the corpus callosum, you would not be able to say this.</u></span>

            <h2>More On Neurulation: Chick Embryo!</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Neural ectoderm plate invaginates, becomes a groove, then buds off as a neural tube</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ 24 hour chick embryo</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Somites</u> are blocks of mesoderm on either side of the neural tube. Each corresponds to piece of the spinal cord</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Brain starting to swell</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ 33 hour chick embryo</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- A lot more swelling of vesicles</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- More somites</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ 48 hour chick embryo</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Head vesicles have expanded greatly, optic vesicle forms (buds off the diencephalon)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- More somites, Wings forminng</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cross section of neural tube</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Right side is dorsal, side with the neural tube</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Circle to the left of neural tube is notochord</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Big neural space at the top is part of the brain, is the diencephalon and telencephalon</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Foramen of Monro</u>: tube that joins the telencephalon and diencephalon</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Small neural space at the bottom is the spinal cord</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Down is dorsal (closer to neural tube)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Dorsal Root Ganglia</u> Groupings to right and left are part of the peripheral nervous system. Form from neural crest cells, form sensory neurons.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor neurons form on the ventral side of spinal cord</span>

            <h2>Structure of Neurons</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Soma</u>: circular cell body</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Dendrites</u>: processes extending outward from cell bodies, receive information from outside, decrements in size like branches</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Axons</u>: processes coming off of soma, transmits information, doesn't decrement in size</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Synaptic terminal</u>: where information output actually occurs</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Boutons</u>: circular endpoints where <u>chemical transmission</u> occurs between synaptic partners</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Chemical transmission occurs via the release of neurotransmitters</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Synaptic Cleft</u>: space between axon terminal and postsynaptic partner (usually dendrite)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Huge influx of calcium allows presynaptic neuron to release packaged neurotransmitters</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Vesicle fuses with presynaptic membrane (Presynaptic terminal), releases neurotransmitter</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane (postsynaptic element)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Postsynaptic partner can be another neuron or a muscle or other things for peripheral neuron (will explain later)</span>

            <h2>Cell Theory</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cell theory used to be applied to all cells except those in the nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Nervous system was thought to be one big syncytium, large mass of stuff, neurons are not individual cells</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Neuron Doctrine</u>: Ramon y Cajal uses Golgi staining to say that the nervous system is not a syncytium and is made up of individual and unique cells, approaching his science like an artist</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Law of dynamic polarization</u>: info goes in to dendrites and out through axons</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Looked at the retina because it was known that information goes from the retina to the brain</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Microglia</u>: immune cells of the brain</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- When foreign stuff comes into brain, become reactive</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Only cell type in the nervous system that does not come from neuroectoderm</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Comes from hematopoietic line</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Macroglia</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Astrocytes</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Found in the central nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Small, star-like, lots of processes</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Involved in synapse stabilization, surround synapses to hold them together</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Important for recycling neurotransmitters (Glutamate has a cycle that necessarily uses glia since the neuron cannot make its own glutamate)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- In the periphery (dorsal root ganglion), there is a similar thing called <u>satellite cells</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Same functions as <u>astrocytes</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Also in the dorsal root ganglion, the neurons are very close together</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ These neurons do not have dendrites and there are no synapses within this ganglion. This is just a place where many neurons live but do not act</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Oligodendrocytes</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Central nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Derive from neural tube</span>

            <h2>Nerves and Neurons Fibers</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Nerves</u>: mixed, have two/three components</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- All have sensory/motor components, some have autonomic components</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Trauma affects all three components</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Interrupt autonomic nerves: loss of <u>trophic factors</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Interrupt motor neurons: weakness</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Interrupt sensory neurons: numbness/pins and needles/burning pain, <u>positive symptoms: paresthesia</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Sensory Components</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Sensory information comes in from, say, receptors on the skin</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- These sensory neurons sit in the dorsal root ganglion (periphery) and connect to both the skin and the spinal cord</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Peripheral neuron</u>: cell body is in periphery</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Sensory neurons are each dedicated to a certain modality/stimulus</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Example: specific sensory nerves react to light touch, to vibration, to pain, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Large Fibers</u>: myelinated</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>Proprioceptive</u>: information is coming back from muscles and joints and telling you about the position of your body. Doesn’t come to consciousness, is just fed into the motor system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>Tactile</u>: touch, vibration, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- <u>Small fibers</u>: unmyelinated</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ sharp pains</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Dull, aching/burning pains</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Changes in temperature, itch</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Can have a problem with either large OR small diameter fibers but not both</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>Congenital Insensitivity to Pain (CIPA or HSAN III)</u>: damage to small fibers, associated with <u>Anhydrosis</u> (cant sweat)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Small fibers do not develop due to a gene that is required for their lineage</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Peripheral autonomic nerves (unmyelinated small nerves that go from autonomic ganglion to the smooth muscle) come from the same lineage as small fibers</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ So both small fibers and peripheral autonomic nerves don’t develop</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Cannot sense pain and does not sweat</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ How do these individuals come to attention (in their first year of life)?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ During teething, baby feels no pain when their teeth come in and they continue teething</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ <u>Self-mutilation</u>: bite off their fingers</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Motor Components</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor neurons connect from spinal cord to skeletal muscle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Central neuron: cell body is in central nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Autonomic Components</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Neuron from spinal cord goes to autonomic ganglion, and another neuron from the autonomic ganglion innervates smooth muscle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Example: <u>Micturition</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ External urethral sphincter is a skeletal muscle (conscious action)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Eventually the smooth muscles in the internal sphincter also contract autonomically/subconsciously</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Axonal Transport</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Need axons if communication is occurring from between far away cells</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Anterograde</u>: sending things from sell body to axon terminal</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Shipment of vesicles, proteins, neurotransmitters, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- The garbage (excess or used proteins) must be shipped back to cell body where there are lysozymes</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Retrograde</u>: sending things from axon terminal back to cell body</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Tau</u>: molecule important for axon transport in both directions</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Pretty unifying theory that all neurodegenerative diseases are due to improper functioning of tau</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Parkinsons, alzheimers, ALS, prion’s disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Huntington’s, etc.</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Why do we have multiple synapses instead of just having huge long axons to communicate between far away places?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Gives flexibility, ability to integrate multiple things so that output is not always same as input</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Example: if we cut sensory neurons, could move for some reasons but not others</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Counter example: if cut motor neuron, could never move that muscle</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor neuron to muscle is 1 to 1 (input = output)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ How does <u>Polio</u> attack motor neurons?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Peripheral neurons have a vulnerability from being in the periphery</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Peripheral motoneurons takes up polio virus and transports it back to CNS</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Neurotropic virus that acts like a trophic factor</span>

            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Spinal cord: has two swellings</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Cervical and lumbo-sacral</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Topographic: areas higher up innervate upper-body, lower areas innervate lower-body</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Cranial nerve vs spinal nerve</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Depends on where nerve leaves from</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Sections of nerves</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Cranial, cervical, trunk, lumbar, sacral</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Sensitive in fingertips not in lumbar region</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Due to number of neurons/receptors in each area</span>

            <h1>Lecture 4: Spinal/Cranial Nerves and Facial Expression</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Spinal Nerve</u>: leaves the vertebral column</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- All have sensory and motor components, some have autonomic</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Cranial Nerves</u>: leave the cranium</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Some have sensory components, some have motor, some are mixed (and have autonomic)</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Facial Nerve (VII)</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ <u>Facial Nerve (VII)</u></span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Mixed cranial nerve</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor aspects</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Innervates muscles of facial expression </span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ These muscles attach to skin (not bone)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Does not include chewing muscles, muscles that move your eyes, or one of the middle ear muscles (tensor tympani)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Innervates the stapedius (middle ear)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ The motor neurons that innervate the muscles of facial expression and the stapedius sit in the same area (Facial Nucleus) in the Central Nervous System</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Autonomic (parasympathetic) effect -> makes tears, saliva, nasal mucosa</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ This neuron also comes from the central nervous system (Salivatory Nucleus), goes to the autonomic ganglion, and another neuron innervates a salivary gland</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Sensory aspects</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Taste from anterior 2/3 of tongue</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ This sensory neuron in the peripheral nervous system goes to the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (NTS) in the central nervous system, which is involved in the perception of taste</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ S-S from part of the ear</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Ear receives somatosensory information from multiple nerves, including the facial nerve</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ This sensory neuron also comes from some ganglion and ends up in the Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus (SVN)  in the central nervous system</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- If cut on one side (<u>Bell’s palsy</u>), symptoms:</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Can’t move half of the face</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Dry mouth, dry eyes, dry nose</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Sounds will start to sound louder (hyperacusis)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Positive signs, dysesthesia/paresthesia – wrong feeling when you should not feel something (ear pain, ringing noise)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Lose some taste in front 2/3 of tongue</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Looking at coronal cross-section through the pons: level of facial colliculus</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Black is staining for myelin/axons</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Gray areas are cell bodies mixed in with axons and dendrites</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Facial nerve comes out of the edge of the pons</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ During development, the facial nerve comes from the pons, and as it migrates they drag behind their axons and go around another cranial nerve nucleus (Abducins nucleus)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- All other cranial nerves shoot straight from the cranium and out</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- If you have a stroke at the abducins nucleus, what symptoms would you have?</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Would be unable to abduct (move laterally) your eye on the side of the injury</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Would not be able to move muscles on that side nor the stapidus (like Bell’s palsy)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ No problems with taste, somatosensory info, or dry mouth/nose/etc. (unlike Bell’s palsy)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Group of functionally related neurons with a functionally related output that is not always all-or-nothing</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ In other words, there’s no actual connection between the facial nucleus and the salivatory nucleus except that the axons that extend from those nuclei “jump on the same street”</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Moebius syndrome</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- No facial expression</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- No naso-labial fold</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Slight adduction of the eye</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>Top-down control of making facial expressions</h2>
            <span class="bullet bullet-1">+ Facial nerve needs information from the cerebral cortex (specifically the motor cortex)</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor cortex innervates motor neurons directly</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ For motor neurons that go to the hands and the feet, go through the corticospinal tract</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ But for motor neurons that go to the facial muscles (expressions, chewing, tongue movement, shrugging, turning head), go through the corticobulbar tract</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Not the eyes though</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Only the nerves for facial expression go through the corticobulbar tract (not the ones for moving the stapedius)	</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor cortex can also innervate interneurons that then innervate motor neurons</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Example: the muscle that allows you to raise one eyebrow at a time</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Say that the top part of the facial nucleus innervates the top muscles of the face and the bottom part of the facial nucleus innervates the bottom half of the face. The motor cortex innervates both the top and bottom halves of the facial nucleus separately</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-3">~ Can do something in one context and not in another</span>
            <span class="bullet bullet-2">- Motor cortex is topographically arranged</span>
